## Recommended (Free) Text Editor and IDE

You are free to use any editor you like. But here are my recommendation:

NOTE: It's important to learn the basic of Java using a plain text editor instead of a full IDE.
Only after you master the basic, then you should use an IDE to speedup productivities.

Text Editor: [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/)

Full IDE: [JetBrains IDEA IntelliJ - Community Version](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
