Notes for teaching Java programming language.

## Learning Path

There is a readme file in each folder for further instruction.

* [Basic Java Programming](basic) - Learn the basic Java programming language syntax and construct
* [Common Tasks in Java](commontasks) - Learn how to do some common tasks with the Java language
* [Maven Build Tool](maven-hello-java) - Learn how to use Maven build tool
* [Ant Build Tool](ant-hello-java) - Learn how to use Ant build tool

## Install and Setup Java Development Kit (JDK)

See instructions in [here](basic/Hello.java).

## Recommended Text Editor and IDE

You are free to use any editor you like. But here are my recommendation:

NOTE: It's important to learn the basic of Java using a plain text editor instead of a full IDE.

Text Editor: [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/)

Full IDE: [JetBrains IDEA IntelliJ - Community Version](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
