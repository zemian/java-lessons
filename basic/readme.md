Learning basic Java Programming Language.

NOTE: It's important to learn the basic of Java using a plain text editor instead of a full IDE.

Java 11 API Reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html

## Goal

I want to introduce Java programming to beginners as quickly as possible. The lessons are short and with
the essential **Main focus** topics that cover common use cases. The main topics will contain working
example code in each lesson. There are also **Further Study** notes to help students to research more
on related topics on their own.

After these lessons, the students should able to understand basic of Java programming language and be
able to read existing code and write simple program on their own.

There are many Java programming patterns and techniques that go beyong the basic syntax. After
these lessons, you may want to explore some [Common Tasks](../commontasks) in Java.

## Install and Setup Java Development Kit (JDK)

See instructions in [here](Hello.java).

NOTE: Some lessons might have additional compilation steps. See the code comments for more details.
